# DiagnoGen 🧠💬

**An AI-powered Symptom Checker using LLMs and SymCAT data**

---

## 🚀 Overview

**DiagnoGen** is an intelligent, interactive symptom-checking app powered by **Generative AI** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It allows users to enter health concerns in natural language and receive probable diagnoses, explanations, and follow-up advice — all based on real-world symptom-disease data from **SymCAT**.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- 🗣️ Accepts free-text input like “I feel dizzy and have a sore throat.”
- 🧠 Uses **LLM (e.g., ChatGPT)** to extract symptoms
- 📊 Maps symptoms to diseases using **SymCAT dataset**
- 💬 Generates friendly, informative responses using **GenAI**
- 🌐 Web-based interface built with **Streamlit**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **OpenAI API** (for LLM/GenAI)
- **SymCAT Dataset**
- (Optional) **Hugging Face Transformers** or other open-source models

🎯 Future Ideas

- Add chatbot-style interface for follow-up questions

- Train a custom lightweight LLM for symptom extraction

- Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud

- Multi-language support
